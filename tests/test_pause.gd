## The pause, and the reason it needs a test at all.
##
## **`Esc` did nothing from M33 until M36.** The guard in `main._unhandled_input` read
## `_summary.visible`, and `_summary` is a `CanvasLayer` whose `visible` is `true` from the moment
## it is added to the tree — what the summary hides and shows is the `Control` *inside* it. So the
## guard was satisfied on every frame of every day and the pause screen was never opened once.
##
## A green suite and a screenshot both passed it, and neither could have caught it: nothing in
## either of them has ever pressed a key. What is asserted here is therefore not "the pause works"
## — that is `--press pause`, in a real run, with a screenshot — but the two things underneath it
## that a unit test *can* hold: **the property that looks like the question is not the question**,
## and the pause puts back the paused state it found rather than assuming one.

## **The dead end.** *(M38: "the lost screen doesn't allow for restarting the game — you can just
## cycle between pause screen and loss screen at that point.")*
##
## Four keys across two screens and none of them started a run: the ending said `esc to quit`, `Esc`
## opened the pause, and the pause offered `Esc` and `Q`. What is asserted is the property that was
## missing rather than the fix — **from every screen the game can come to rest on, some key starts a
## run** — so a later screen that forgets it fails here rather than in somebody's evening.
##
## The keys are pushed as real `InputEventKey`s, because that is what the two screens read and it is
## exactly the difference the M36 bug turned on. `--press key:r` is the same check in a real window.
