## How the asset pipeline is put together

- `assets/tiles/*.svg` — 17 ground tiles, 32×32, hand-editable. **There is no regeneration
  script**; they were emitted once and are now the source of truth.
- `assets/ground_tileset.tres` — one `TileSetAtlasSource` per tile. **Source ids are
  positional and `src/city/ground_tiles.gd` mirrors them by hand.** Adding a tile means
  appending to both, in the same order.
- `src/city/ground_tiles.gd` — the only place that decides which tile a cell gets.
- `assets/buildings/*.svg` — 11 building tiles, 32×32. `wall`/`roof` are fills (modulated);
  `wall_edge_*`, `wall_base`, `roof_edge_*`, `window_*` are alpha overlays drawn on top at
  full colour. No `TileSet` here: `Building._draw()` assembles them per lot, which keeps one
  node per building and lets a lot pick its own colour.
- `assets/rig/`, `assets/props/`, `assets/events/` — feet-anchored sprites, drawn through
  `Sprites.draw_standing()`: the node sits on the ground plane, the art rises from it.
  Anything whose size carries meaning (a fire's flames, a barrier's width) passes an
  explicit size rather than using the texture's own.

Run `./tools/check.sh` after touching assets; it does the import pass that generates
`.import` files.
