## Gotchas learned in M13

- **A runtime error in a test suite hangs the runner; it does not fail it.** `run_tests.gd`
  calls each suite synchronously and quits at the end, so an error aborts `_ready()` before
  the quit and the headless process sits there printing nothing. Deleting `busy_road` left
  three suites calling `by_id("busy_road").intensity`, and the symptom was a test run that
  produced *no output at all* for six minutes. No output means an error, not a slow suite.
- **A negative-width `Rect2` normalises** — already in `CLAUDE.md` from M12c, and it bit
  again here: it is the same helper the whole crowd draws through.
- **Moving a `Node2D` does not invalidate its draw list.** The transform is applied when the
  retained list is replayed, so 530 agents only need `queue_redraw()` when their *picture*
  changes — a turn, a flip — not when they move. That is the difference between 530 redraws
  a frame and a handful.
- **Give each agent its own RNG.** Seeded per agent from the day, not shared, so a turn
  taken at a junction cannot depend on the order agents happen to reach junctions in — which
  frame timing would otherwise decide, and determinism would be a lie.
