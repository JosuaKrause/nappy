## M1 — Movement & camera · `feature/core-movement`

- [x] `stroller.tscn` CharacterBody2D, walk/run, acceleration & friction
- [x] Procedural 2.5D drawing of mother + stroller, feet-anchored
- [x] Facing direction, stroller leads in the direction of travel
- [x] `Camera2D` follow with smoothing + movement look-ahead
- [x] Debug scene: 3x3 street grid matching the constants M3's generator will use
- [x] Y-sorting verified (player draws over a wall she is standing in front of)
- [x] `tools/shot.sh` — render a frame to PNG, since a headless boot never calls `_draw()`

### Deferred out of M1

- [ ] The pram has no collision of its own — only the mother's feet do, so the pram clips
      into walls when she hugs a corner. Options: a second body that trails her, or a
      capsule that rotates with `facing`. Not worth solving before the city exists.
- [x] Buildings taller than their lot depth would have no roof left to draw; `roof_depth()`
      clamps rather than warns. *(M12b: heights are whole tiles now, and the clamp is exact
      — the wall never takes the last row.)*
