## Gotchas learned in M12b

- **Edge overlays beat corner tiles.** The roof parapet is four edge tiles drawn on top of
  the roof fill, each transparent apart from its own band. A corner cell takes two of them
  and the parapet turns by itself — no corner tiles, and no combinatorial explosion when a
  roof is only one tile deep and a row has to be both its north and its south edge.
- **Multiply the colour, not the art.** Wall and roof fills are authored near-white and
  passed the variant colour as `draw_texture`'s modulate, so six roof colours cost one
  asset. Windows are drawn *after*, unmodulated: a lit window is the same warm colour
  whatever the building is painted.
