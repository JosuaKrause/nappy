## M5 — Act I events · `feature/events-act1`

- [x] `playground` (ambient), `busy_road` (ambient, sampled along two arterials)
- [x] `cat_dash` — the tutorial obstacle
- [x] `dog_walker` (mobile, slower than walking), `delivery_van`
- [x] `homeless_yeller` with pulsing intensity envelope
- [x] `busker`, `construction` (emits **and** physically blocks)
- [x] `fire_truck` one-shot: mobile siren that leaves a `burning_building` behind it
- [x] Supporting features: `PathMode` (cross-street / along-street), `obstructs_radius`,
      `spawns_on_finish`, `AmbientSource.MAIN_ROAD`, fire rendering
- [x] Fairness contract strengthened: an event faster than walking must be clearable
      across its **whole** radius, not just its falloff band
- [x] `tests/test_event_manager.gd` — integration against a real generated city
- [x] Dev flag: `--follow <event id>`, `--spawn event:<id>`

### Deferred out of M5

- [ ] The `burning_building` spawns exactly where the engine stopped, which is in the road
      rather than in a building. Nudging it to the nearest `BUILDING` tile would read much
      better and is a few lines.
- [x] `busy_road` is 14 separate instances. Fine for a linear scan, but a single
      polyline-shaped source would be tidier and cheaper. *(M13: retired entirely — the
      crowd is the arterial noise now.)*
- [ ] No audio, so every "you hear it coming" telegraph is currently visual only (M10).
