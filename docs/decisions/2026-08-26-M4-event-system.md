## M4 — Event system · `feature/event-system`

- [x] `event_def.gd` + `event_catalogue.gd` (defined in code, not `.tres`)
- [x] `event_instance.gd`: lifetime, telegraph phase, pulse envelope, path following,
      falloff contribution, hard-fail gating
- [x] `event_manager.gd`: live instances, retirement, `total_excitement_at`
- [x] `Tuning.validate_event()` asserted over the whole catalogue in a test
- [x] Telegraph visuals: `event_aura_layer.gd` under the entities, amber-and-flashing while
      telegraphing, red once active, tracking the pulse so the field breathes
- [x] `event_scheduler.gd`: budget, weights, one-shot spreading and consumption, determinism
- [x] "Always one usable calm zone" rule
- [x] `tests/test_events.gd` (149 checks)
- [x] Dev flags: `--day N`, `--spawn event`; `tools/shot.sh` now waits in seconds
- [~] Three representative events only (ambient / mobile burst / stationary pulse).
      M5 fills in the rest of Act I.
- [ ] Audio cues — no audio in the project yet; lands in M10

### Decisions taken during M4

- **No spatial hash.** The budget topped out near 22 concurrent events; a linear scan is
  free and a hash would be more code with more ways to be wrong. *(M19's density pass took
  that to ~25, and the decision is unchanged — the crowd has been doing 530 linear distance
  checks a frame since M13 and is not the bottleneck either.)*
- **No `impulse` field.** A sharp spike is a short `duration` at high `intensity`, which
  keeps the whole excitement model a pure query with nothing pushed at the baby.
- **Ambient events are exempt from the telegraph contract.** They never "appear", so there
  is nothing to warn about; the player learns them on day 1 of a fixed city.
