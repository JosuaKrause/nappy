## M3 — City generation · `feature/city-generation`

- [x] `tile.gd` TileType metadata (walkable / calm / alley / road / colour)
- [x] `city_map.gd`: tile grid, layout maths, BFS distances
- [x] `city_generator.gd`: street grid, districts, alleys, plazas, parks, home
- [x] Carving as rect subtraction, so holes compose without special cases
- [x] Connectivity flood-fill + retry on failure
- [x] Generation guarantees (park count, spread, home distance, exact building coverage)
- [x] `city.gd`: procedural 2.5D buildings, ground, kerbs, crossings, park props
- [x] Building collision bodies + a boundary wall around the map
- [x] Calm zone + alley effects wired through `WorldContext` into `baby.gd`
- [x] `tests/test_generator.gd` over 200 seeds, plus a route-redundancy sweep
- [x] Dev flags: `--seed`, `--overview`, `--spawn park|alley|square|playground`

### Deferred out of M3

- [ ] Park trees are placed by rejection sampling and clump. Poisson-disc or a simple
      minimum-spacing check would spread them without much work.
- [ ] Districts affect building height and alley chance but nothing else yet. `INDUSTRIAL`
      and `CIVIC` should read differently at a glance before Act II makes them narrative.
- [ ] The generator is deterministic per seed but `generate()` retries with `seed + 1`,
      so a run's city is not strictly `run_seed` — it is the first nearby seed that passes.
      Fine, but worth remembering when reproducing a bug from a seed.
